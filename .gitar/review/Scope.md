# Review scope
- Report each distinct root cause once. If a response-shape change breaks its own tests, report that as a single finding — do not additionally raise a separate finding comparing it against how sibling endpoints are shaped.
- Do not require a new test to be added for every internal logic change. The existing rule that new HTTP endpoints must include a test still applies as-is; a modification inside an existing endpoint's logic does not need its own dedicated test to avoid a finding.
